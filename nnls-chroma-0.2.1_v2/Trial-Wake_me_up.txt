D(Dmaj7)

Feeling my way through the darkness
Bm(D6)						D(D6)

Guided by a beating heart


I can't tell where the journey will end


But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand

They say I'm caught up in a dream


Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes


Well that's fine by me


So wake me up when it's all over
Bm(Bm7)						D(Dmaj7)

When I'm wiser and I'm older
				G(G6)

All this time I was finding myself

And I didn't know I was lost
