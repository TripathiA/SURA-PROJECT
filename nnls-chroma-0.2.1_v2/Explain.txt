Chords[FrameNo.,ChordNo.] --> Input to Viterbi Algorithm

-- Viterbi returns the chord corresponding to each Frame.

STEP 1 :
	Each chord is assigned a best state.
	Best state is chosen among all the states i.e chords from the previous frame.
	We have a transition matrix with values of probability of going from one chord to another.

	istate - state of previous frame
	jstate - state of current frame
	iframe - frame Number we are currently on
	trans  - matrix of transiion probablities
	delta  - matrix of conditional probablities
	nState - total number of chords.

	" double currentValue = delta[(iFrame-1) * nState + iState] * trans[iState][jState]; "


STEP 2:
	Now we go to a frame and check the chord detected for the next frame. ( Base case is "N" for the last frame.)
	Depending on that we see what was the best state for that chord and that is the chord of the current frame.
	So we do the recursion from last to first chord.



MODIFICATION :
While calculating the best state from previous frame, we kept in mind the scale and gave more preference to the group of chords which are contained in that scale.

 " double currentValue = delta[(iFrame-1) * nState + iState] * trans[iState][jState] * factor[iState]; "
 factor is the vector which contains more value for the corresponding chords of the scale rather than other values.
