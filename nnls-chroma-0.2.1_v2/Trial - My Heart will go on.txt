Every night in my dreams


I see you, I feel you


That is how I know you go on


Far across the distance


And spaces between us
					B(B/F#)

You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are


I believe that the heart does go on


Once more you open the door

And you're here in my heart

And my heart will go on and on
A(E)					B(B6)

Love can touch us one time


And last for a lifetime
A(Am)

And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
E(E/B)


One true time I hold to
A("NO CHORD")

In my life we'll always go on
