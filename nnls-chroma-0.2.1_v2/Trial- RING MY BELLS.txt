Ring my bell, ring my bells.
F#m(F#)

Ring my bell, ring my bells.

Ring my bell, ring my bells.

Ring my bell, ring my bells.

Sometimes you love it

Sometimes you don't

Sometimes you need it, then you don't, then you let go.

Sometimes we rush it

Sometimes we fall

It doesn't matter, baby, we can take it real slow.

'Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny

And the way that you move, oh, you make me feel alive

Come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells.

Ring my bell, ring my bells.

You try to hide it

I know you do

When all you really want is me to come and get you

You move in closer

I feel you breathe (I feel you breathe)

It's like the world just disappears when you're around me, oh
